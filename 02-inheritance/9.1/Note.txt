- A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a superclass.
- Classes that extend a superclass, called subclasses, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors of the superclass without repeating these in the code.
- The keyword extends is used to establish an inheritance relationship between a subclass and a superclass. A class can extend only one superclass.
- Extending a subclass from a superclass creates an is-a relationship from the subclass to the superclass.
